# Data Versioning and Differential Privacy Project

## Project Description

This project was developed as part of my coursework to better understand how data versioning supports reproducible machine learning workflows. I compared DVC and Delta Lake using a dataset of CrossFit athletes and built a simple Random Forest regression model to predict the total lift weight.

To make the project more realistic, I also added a DP step using the Laplace Mechanism to see how privacy noise affects model performance. The goal was to gain practical experience with version control, data reproducibility and privacy tradeoffs.
